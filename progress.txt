# 22nd March 2021
I have updated the rules for eslint and have integrated TypeScript with eslint, removing depreciated dependency of tslint.
I have also removed legacy code for the support for pawconfig.json and have reduced the number of commands the CLI supports.

One of the major change that I did is remove support for .env file other than the root folder. I did my research and
I personally think the .env file should be unique and should be at the root folder only, thus removed a lot of code that was creating complexity.

I also removed the code for adding parent's parent's (2) node_module detection from the path of executables.

I have changed @pawjs/tapable with package 'tapable' by core create of webpack as they have added support for browsers as well.

My plan futher:
 - I want to write test case for the CLI and add comments to paw.js and cli.ts
 - I want to update the webpack and webpack dev server with latest API
 - I want to configure the webpack-dev-server with latest css minifier plugin and add support or CSS in JS
